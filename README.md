# Disease-Prediction-from-Genomic-Data-using-Few-Shot-Learning
This project explores the use of few-shot learning to predict diseases based on genomic sequences, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in bioinformatics. By applying models like Prototypical Networks and Siamese Networks, we enable disease classification with high accuracy using only a few training examples per class.
